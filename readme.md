# Anomali Detection and Predict Lifetime Electric Motor WEG w-21 
The data is collected through the Yaskawa U1000 VSD system, which records electrical parameters of WEG W-21 Motor, such as voltage, current, power, etc. Temperature is measured using FLIR and processed through image processing. 

The analysis is conducted using the Local Outlier Factor (LOF), Isolation Forest to detect anomalies and Logarithmic Regression to predict motor lifetime. Generative Adversarial Network is used to generate new data that resembles real data.
